# lean-cbs: Verified Capability-Based Security for LLM Agents

A Lean 4 implementation of a formally verified access control layer for LLM agents.

Agent frameworks typically enforce access policies with runtime checks such as whitelists,
tool gating, system prompt instructions. These are fragile: a policy is only as strong
as the check that enforces it, and prompt injection can cause an LLM to violate its
own stated policy. This project takes a different approach.

Every action an agent wants to take must be backed by an unforgeable capability token
issued by an orchestrator. When an LLM emits a program as structured JSON, a
verifier checks that every action is backed by a real, issued capability and produces a
proof (`SafeProg env prog`). The interpreter (`CapM.runSafe`)
cannot be called without this proof.

The file `leancap-report.pdf` contains a full project report.
